In this file, some features I have added to enhance the Recipe Display Application for my chocolate chip cookie recipe include:
    
    1) A display() function that is carried out when the user clicks either of the h3 elements
    2) The next() method which traverses the DOM tree to the element following the selected element, this case being the ingredients or instructions list
    3) The fadeIn() method which is used to fade in a hidden element. I used the value "fast" to control the speed the element is faded in
    4) I changed the background color of the <body> section to pink and centered the h2 heading "Chocolate Chip Cookies"
